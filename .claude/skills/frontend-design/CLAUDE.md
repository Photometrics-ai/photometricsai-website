# Claude Instructions: Frontend Design

## When to Invoke This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Build web components, pages, or applications
- Create UI/UX implementations
- Design distinctive frontend interfaces
- Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Build a landing page for..."
- "Create a component that..."
- "Design a dashboard for..."
- "Make this look more distinctive"
- "I need a frontend for..."

## Core Principle

**Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.**

The goal is memorable, intentional design with a clear aesthetic point-of-view. Every interface should feel genuinely designed for its context.

## How to Use This Skill

### Before Coding

1. Read SKILL.md for full design guidelines
2. Understand the context:
   - **Purpose:** What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
   - **Tone:** Pick a BOLD aesthetic direction (see options below)
   - **Constraints:** Framework, performance, accessibility requirements
   - **Differentiation:** What's the one thing someone will remember?

### Aesthetic Directions (Pick One)

Choose an extreme and commit to it:
- Brutally minimal
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Organic/natural
- Luxury/refined
- Playful/toy-like
- Editorial/magazine
- Brutalist/raw
- Art deco/geometric
- Soft/pastel
- Industrial/utilitarian

### While Coding

Focus on these areas:

**Typography:**
- Choose distinctive, characterful fonts (NOT Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Pair a display font with a refined body font
- Unexpected font choices elevate the design

**Color & Theme:**
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid even palettes

**Motion:**
- High-impact moments over scattered micro-interactions
- Staggered reveals on page load create delight
- Scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

**Spatial Composition:**
- Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

**Backgrounds & Details:**
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT use generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Do NOT use cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Do NOT create predictable, cookie-cutter layouts
- Do NOT converge on common choices across different projects
- Do NOT hold back - commit fully to the aesthetic direction

## Matching Complexity to Vision

- **Maximalist designs:** Need elaborate code, extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist designs:** Need restraint, precision, careful attention to spacing and subtle details

Elegance comes from executing the vision well, not from picking one style over another.
