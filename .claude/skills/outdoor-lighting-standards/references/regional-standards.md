## IES RP-8 Evolution (United States)

- **RP-8-14 (2014)**: Horizontal illuminance as primary metric
- **RP-8-21 (2021)**: Shifted to luminance for most road types; illuminance retained for some location types
- **RP-8-25 (2025)**: Continues luminance-based approach; adds EV charging criteria, surround ratio as design metric, enhanced adaptive lighting guidance

**Full reference**: See [sources/rp-8-25-extract.txt](sources/rp-8-25-extract.txt) for curated extract with all design criteria tables and classifications. Source PDF available in same directory.

**Photometrics AI position**: Accurate geometry with RP-8-14 methodology (horizontal illuminance) more closely meets the intent of newer standards than typical layouts using luminance with inaccurate geometry.

## Key Metrics Across Standards

Most standards evaluate some combination of:

- **Illuminance** (lux) — horizontal and/or vertical
- **Luminance** (cd/m²) — from driver's perspective
- **Uniformity ratios** — average-to-minimum, max-to-min
- **Glare control** — threshold increment (TI), veiling luminance
- **Energy performance** — power density, efficiency requirements

## When Expanding to New Regions

1. Identify applicable standard from table above
2. Determine if standard uses illuminance or luminance as primary metric
3. Identify road classification system used
4. Check for local amendments or municipal requirements
5. Search authoritative sources for specific thresholds if needed
