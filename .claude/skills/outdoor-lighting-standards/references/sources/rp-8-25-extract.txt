================================================================================
STREET CLASSIFICATIONS (Section 11.3.1)
================================================================================

Major (arterial): Principal network for through-traffic flow. Connects areas of
  principal traffic generation and important roadways entering/leaving the city.
  Primarily serves through-traffic; secondarily provides access to abutting property.

Collector: Traffic between major and local streets. Used mainly for traffic
  movements within residential, commercial, and industrial areas. May carry
  truck/bus movements; gives direct service to abutting properties.

Local: Used primarily for direct access to residential, commercial, industrial,
  or other abutting property. Large percentage of total street system but carries
  small proportion of vehicular traffic.

Alleyway (laneway): Very narrow urban street or lane. Primarily used as service
  lanes for utility poles, fire escapes, garage access, delivery loading, garbage.

================================================================================
PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATIONS (Section 11.3.2)
================================================================================

High: ≥100 pedestrians during highest nightly average one-hour volume period.
  Example: downtown areas with dense urban development (>3,000 ped/km²).

Medium: 11–99 pedestrians during highest nightly average one-hour volume period.
  Default assumption when pedestrian volume is not known.

Low: ≤10 pedestrians during highest nightly average one-hour volume period.
  Jurisdiction should define whether sidewalk lighting is required.

Note: Pedestrian activity levels change throughout darkness hours. Adaptive
lighting controls that allow dimming should be considered.

================================================================================
HIGHWAY CLASSIFICATIONS (Section 10.2.1)
================================================================================

Freeway Class A: Freeways with higher volumes. Generally urban freeways.
Freeway Class B: Freeways with lower volumes. Generally rural freeways.
Expressway: Divided highway with partial access control. May have at-grade
  intersections, increasing complexity and conflict points.

================================================================================
PAVEMENT CLASSIFICATIONS (Section 3.1.5)
================================================================================

R1: Portland cement concrete (diffuse reflection, specular factor S1 < 0.42)
R2: Asphalt with aggregate (mixed reflection, 0.42 ≤ S1 < 0.85) — most common
R3: Asphalt (slightly specular, 0.85 ≤ S1 < 1.35)
R4: Smooth asphalt (very specular, S1 ≥ 1.35)

Note: R2 and R3 are the most common pavement types and are often grouped together
in criteria tables. When pavement classification is unknown, R2/R3 is assumed.

================================================================================
ROUNDABOUT LIGHTING (Section 12.4)
================================================================================

Horizontal illuminance: Use Table 12-1 values based on road classification and
  pedestrian volumes. For roundabouts on unlit roadways, use Local/Local values.

Vertical illuminance in crosswalks: Average vertical illuminance at 1.5m height
  should equal the required horizontal illuminance for the roundabout.

Pole placement: Perimeter lighting recommended (NOT center island). Place poles
  on the approaching driver's side of crosswalks, approximately 0.7 mounting
  heights away from the crosswalk.

Table 12-3: Stopping Sight Distances in Roundabouts
Design Speed km/h (mi/h) | Distance m (ft)
10 (10)                   | 8.1 (27)
20 (15)                   | 18.5 (61)
30 (20)                   | 31.2 (102)

MIDBLOCK CROSSWALK LIGHTING (Section 12.6)
================================================================================

Table 12-4: Vertical Light Levels at Midblock Crosswalks
Roadway Condition        | Maintained Avg Vertical Illuminance
Unlit roadway            | 20 lux (1.9 fc)
Continuously lit roadway | 20 lux (1.9 fc)

Vertical illuminance calculated at 1.5m (5 ft) above road surface.
Calculations extend across roadway and 1m (3.3 ft) onto sidewalk.
Grid spacing: 0.5m (1.65 ft) along crosswalk centerline.

================================================================================
SURROUND RATIO (Section 10.5.2.3)
================================================================================

SR criterion: 0.8 (ratio of average illuminance of 3.6m surround area adjacent
to travel way / average illuminance of travel lane).

SR improves object detection distance on and adjacent to roadway.
Should be considered a design metric per CIE recommendations.
CIE has renamed SR as Edge Illuminance Ratio (EIR).

Exceptions where SR may not apply:
- Residential local roads with low pedestrian volumes
- Rural roundabouts with low pedestrian/cyclist volumes
- Environmentally sensitive areas
- Bridges without adequate shoulder width
- Streets where sidewalk lighting already provides visibility improvement

================================================================================

  Values decrease with lower lighting zones (LZ3 through LZ0).
  Motion sensing required to reduce levels when no one is present.

Vertical illuminance measured at 1.5m in primary vehicular travel directions.

================================================================================
LIGHT TRESPASS LIMITS (Section 4.3, Table 4-3)
================================================================================

Maximum initial vertical illuminance at property line varies by lighting zone
and pre/post-curfew timing. Refer to Table 4-3 in source document.

================================================================================
CALCULATION METHODOLOGY NOTES
================================================================================

Recommended calculation methods by application:
- Highways:      Luminance (primary), illuminance for field validation
- Streets:       Luminance (primary), illuminance for field validation
- Cul-de-sacs:   Illuminance
- Intersections:  Illuminance
- Roundabouts:   Horizontal illuminance + vertical illuminance in crosswalks
- Walkways:      Horizontal + vertical illuminance
- Parking:       Illuminance
- Crosswalks:    Vertical illuminance

Grid placement (Section 3.8.3):
- Roadway: Points spaced per standard grid requirements
- Sidewalks: At least 10 points, no more than 5m apart, centered on walkway
- Cul-de-sacs: Grid spacing ≤ 2m
- Roundabouts: Grid spacing ≤ 2m
- Crosswalk vertical: 1.5m height, 0.5m spacing along centerline

Veiling luminance ratio not calculated for intersections or roundabouts
(geometry makes it invalid). Low glare optics recommended instead.

================================================================================
ADAPTIVE LIGHTING (Section 6.10)
================================================================================

Adaptive lighting allows light levels to be adjusted based on:
- Time of night
- Traffic volumes
- Pedestrian activity
- Weather conditions
- Special events

RP-8-25 provides for adaptive lighting through Annex K Alternative Lighting
Criteria Selection Methodology, which uses crash analysis and lighting
performance to determine appropriate criteria for different conditions.

Section 6.10.2 covers adaptive lighting design including dimming profiles.
Section 6.10.3 covers adaptive lighting operations.

================================================================================
KEY CHANGES FROM RP-8-14 AND RP-8-21
================================================================================

RP-8-14 (2014): Horizontal illuminance as primary metric for all applications.
RP-8-21 (2021): Shifted to luminance for most road types; illuminance retained
  for intersections, cul-de-sacs, walkways, parking.
RP-8-25 (2025): Continues luminance-based approach. Key additions:
  - EV charging station criteria (new in parking chapter)
  - Updated parking lot and garage criteria with motion sensing requirements
  - Surround ratio (SR) as design metric, aligned with CIE Edge Illuminance Ratio
  - Enhanced adaptive lighting guidance
  - Midblock crosswalk vertical illuminance requirements
  - Roundabout lighting methodology refinement

PHOTOMETRICS AI POSITION:
Accurate geometry with horizontal illuminance (RP-8-14 methodology) more
closely meets the intent of newer standards than typical layouts using
luminance with inaccurate geometry. The geometric and contextual errors
in typical layouts exceed the illuminance-vs-luminance methodology gap.
