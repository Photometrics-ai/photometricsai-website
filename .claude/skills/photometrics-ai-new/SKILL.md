# Photometrics AI

**Tagline:** Where Light Meets Intelligence  
**Core proposition:** Precision software for smarter street and roadway lighting  
**Founder:** Ari Isaak, GISP | **CTO:** Bill Dollins | **Contact:** ari@photometrics.ai | 858-633-6447

## What It Is

Photometrics AI is a software platform that optimizes public lighting performance through networked lighting controls. It determines the optimal operating parameters for each luminaire based on real-world geography, lighting standards, and configurable priorities, then sends those parameters to existing lighting control systems via API.

**Software-only. No hardware. No retrofits. No field activity.**

## Application Scope

Photometrics AI works wherever outdoor lighting is present: city streets, suburban neighborhoods, rural roads, highways, parks, campuses, industrial areas. It is not limited to any population density or geographic classification. Benefits apply to the entire lighting system as an interconnected whole, not individual fixtures.

## How It Works (4 Components)

1. **Target Lighting Layer (TLL)** — GIS-based maps specifying desired illumination levels for distinct zones (crosswalks: 20 lux, streets: 7-11 lux, sidewalks: 2 lux, building footprints: 0 lux). Patented: US9894736B2.

2. **Optimization Engine** — AI-accelerated system that tests thousands of lighting configurations in minutes. Generates in-house labeled training data for deep learning models specific to each luminaire type. Patent pending: 18/660,680.

3. **Dynamic Scheduling** — Priority-based calendar resolving which lighting instruction runs based on time, events, or real-time triggers.

4. **NLC Integration** — API communication with lighting control platforms (integrated with 2 major systems) to apply optimized parameters.

## Energy Savings Mechanism

Photometrics AI achieves significant energy savings through two mechanisms:

1. **Precision design optimization** — Per-luminaire dimming based on actual geometry, overlapping beam spreads, and Target Lighting Layers. Replaces cookie-cutter "typical layouts" that ignore real-world conditions.

2. **Time-of-night dimming** — As vehicle miles traveled and pedestrian activity decline overnight, lights dim further while maintaining safety standards.

**For specific savings percentages and financial calculations, see the photometrics-ai-financials skill.**

## Operating Hours Definition

Street lights operate from the end of civil dusk (beginning of nautical dusk) to the end of nautical dawn (beginning of civil dawn). This period is called "dusk-to-dawn" or approximately 4,100-4,165 hours annually (averaging 11.4 hours per night).

## Priority Hierarchy (Critical)

Photometrics AI **never averages or compromises** between competing priorities. Strict hierarchy—higher priorities are never degraded for lower ones:

1. **Dispatch** — CAD system integration (fire, crash codes) triggers 500ft illumination
2. **Demand Side Management** — Grid operator emergency triggers strategic dimming
3. **Transportation Safety** — Crosswalks, bike lanes, high-injury locations get +2 lux dusk-8PM
4. **Crime Prevention** — High drug/vehicle theft areas get increased lighting
5. **Special Events** — MLB games, Halloween (most dangerous night—treat local roads as crosswalks)
6. **Migratory Birds** — BirdCast integration dims low-speed/low-crime areas 2AM-sunrise on high-migration nights
7. **Default** — On at dusk, midnight dimming (sidewalks/yards to 0 lux), off at dawn

## National Energy Impact

With approximately 26-60 million streetlights in the US, Photometrics AI's optimization approach can deliver grid-scale energy savings equivalent to hundreds of thousands of homes.

## Current Traction

**Deployed lights: 0** (as of January 2025)

**Pipeline:**
- **8,500 lights (Tennessee)** — Contract with ESCO partner; ON HIATUS while ESCO negotiates with utility. Not deployed.
- **2,000 lights (Mississippi)** — Awaiting city council approval. Not deployed.

**Product status:**
- Core platform complete: optimization engine, scheduling, API integrations
- Integrated with **2 major NLC systems**
- Software tested and operational

**Final development in progress:**
- Training currently runs on 50 lights (for speed) — results not yet highly accurate
- Building TLL adjustment tool to create variable training scenarios for better distribution
- This is the last step before full production deployment

**Do not claim:**
- "X streetlights in active deployment"
- "Running in Memphis right now"
- Any deployed/operational claims until projects go live

## Patents & IP

- **US9894736B2** (granted 2018): Target Lighting Layers
- **18/660,680** (pending, issuance expected soon): AI training data methodology
- **Continuation filed** on 18/660,680 — will result in 2 patents from this application

**Total: 3 patents** (1 granted, 1 issuing soon, 1 continuation pending)

- Proprietary labeled training dataset—competitors would need years to replicate
