# Value Proposition & Messaging

**For specific financial figures, ROI calculations, and value methodology, see the photometrics-ai-financials skill.**

## The Core Value Proposition

Photometrics AI delivers quantifiable financial value to both municipalities and utilities, with ROI typically under 12 months — compared to years for LED retrofits.

## Value by Stakeholder

### For Street Light Owners and Operators (SLOOs)

SLOOs include cities, counties, state highway departments, IOUs, municipal utilities, and cooperatives.

**Asset Management Benefits:**
- Extend luminaire life through optimized dimming
- Reduce maintenance truck rolls and costs
- Significant energy savings while maintaining lighting quality
- Better long-term budgeting and asset planning

**Quality of Life Benefits:**
- Crime reduction through CPTED principles
- Traffic incident reduction (FHWA Proven Safety Countermeasure)
- Grid stability and demand response capability
- Support for Vision Zero and climate action goals

**Key message:** "Photometrics AI delivers significant per-streetlight value annually. The cost to implement is far outweighed by the financial benefits. See photometrics-ai-financials skill for specific figures."

### For Utilities

**Avoided Costs (see photometrics-ai-financials for ACC methodology):**
- Energy savings reduce wholesale procurement costs
- Generation capacity avoidance defers investment
- T&D capacity avoidance extends equipment life
- GHG compliance cost reduction

**Grid Operations Benefits:**
- Reduce evening and early-morning peak loading on LV feeders
- Controllable load with no customer disruption
- Surgical load shedding during emergencies prevents cascading outages
- Street lighting = 1-3% of total demand, higher share at night when active

**California Example:**
- 4.1M streetlights consuming 205 MW during peak
- 145 MW controllable demand reduction every summer evening
- Equivalent battery storage: ~$174M + years of permitting
- Photometrics AI: <1% of cost, deploy in under 1 month

**Key message:** "Street lighting is one of the largest predictable evening loads on distribution networks that can be managed without customer impact, field activity, or infrastructure changes."

---

### For ESCOs and Channel Partners

- Differentiated offering beyond commoditized LED retrofits
- Recurring revenue through SaaS model
- No hardware inventory or installation complexity
- Scalable across portfolio
- Measurable performance improvement for clients

**Key message:** "Add intelligent optimization to your service offering. Deliver ongoing value and recurring revenue."

---

### For Communities and Citizens

- Safer streets without construction disruption
- Environmental protection (BirdCast integration, reduced light pollution)
- Support for nighttime economy and vibrant neighborhoods
- Equitable service — data-driven, not politically influenced
- Benefits within weeks, not years

**Key message:** "Implementation requires no disruption to daily life. Communities see benefits immediately without torn-up streets or lengthy project timelines."

## Messaging by Use Case

### Energy Efficiency Pitch

"Delivers significant energy savings by coordinating all light sources to work together as a system, meeting lighting standards as closely as possible while maintaining or improving lighting quality in critical areas. Savings come from precision design optimization and time-of-night dimming when traffic and pedestrian activity decline."

"Human eyes cannot perceive brightness changes under 20%, especially at night. This allows significant optimization headroom — a light at 72% vs 100% looks identical to observers but saves substantial energy."

### Transportation Safety Pitch

"Nearly half of all traffic crashes occur at night despite only 25% of VMT happening after dark. Darkness contributes to 76% of pedestrian fatalities. FHWA recognizes effective street lighting as a Proven Safety Countermeasure."

**FHWA data — lighting can reduce crashes:**
- 42% for nighttime injury pedestrian crashes at intersections
- 33-38% for nighttime crashes at rural/urban intersections
- 28% for nighttime injury crashes on rural/urban highways

### Grid Flexibility Pitch

"Street lighting is ubiquitous, already connected, on at grid peak, and uses 1-3% of grid capacity. It's one of the largest predictable and controllable loads on distribution networks."

"When the electric grid was built, it anticipated downtime at night. The new pressures of solar duck curves, EVs, and data centers specifically require flexibility between dusk and dawn."

### Crime Prevention Pitch

"Reductions in nighttime outdoor crime deliver measurable savings to local governments who fund 66% of police protection and bear emergency service costs. See photometrics-ai-financials for specific value calculations."

"Better lighting supports CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) principles with data-driven targeting of high-risk areas."

### Environmental Pitch

"For any given location, over half of annual bird migration occurs on just 10% of nights. Migration altitude decreases steadily during early morning hours, increasing collision risk. Photometrics AI responds to real-time BirdCast data."

"Energy reduction translates directly to reduced carbon emissions, helping cities meet climate commitments without expensive new infrastructure."
