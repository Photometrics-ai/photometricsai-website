# Photometrics AI

**Tagline:** Where Light Meets Intelligence  
**Core proposition:** Precision software for smarter street and roadway lighting  
**Founder:** Ari Isaak, GISP | **CTO:** Bill Dollins | **Contact:** ari@photometrics.ai | 858-633-6447

## What It Is

Photometrics AI is a software platform that optimizes public lighting performance through networked lighting controls. It determines the optimal operating parameters for each luminaire based on real-world geography, lighting standards, and configurable priorities, then sends those parameters to existing lighting control systems via API.

**Software-only. No hardware. No retrofits. No field activity.**

## Application Scope

Photometrics AI works wherever outdoor lighting is present: city streets, suburban neighborhoods, rural roads, highways, parks, campuses, industrial areas. It is not limited to any population density or geographic classification. Benefits apply to the entire lighting system as an interconnected whole, not individual fixtures.

## How It Works (4 Components)

1. **Target Lighting Layer (TLL)** — GIS-based maps specifying desired illumination levels for distinct zones (crosswalks: 20 lux, streets: 7-11 lux, sidewalks: 2 lux, building footprints: 0 lux). Patented: US9894736B2.

2. **Optimization Engine** — AI-accelerated system that tests thousands of lighting configurations in minutes. Generates in-house labeled training data for deep learning models specific to each luminaire type. Patent pending: 18/660,680.

3. **Dynamic Scheduling** — Priority-based calendar resolving which lighting instruction runs based on time, events, or real-time triggers.

4. **NLC Integration** — API communication with lighting control platforms (integrated with 2 major systems) to apply optimized parameters.

## How 40% Energy Savings Is Achieved

Photometrics AI delivers 40% total system energy savings through two mechanisms:

1. **25% through precision design optimization** — Applied dusk-to-dawn. Per-luminaire dimming based on actual geometry, overlapping beam spreads, and Target Lighting Layers. Replaces cookie-cutter "typical layouts" that ignore real-world conditions.

2. **15% through early morning dimming** — Applied 1AM-6AM. As vehicle miles traveled and pedestrian activity decline, applicable lighting standards decrease. Lights dim an additional ~34% during these hours in low-speed, low-crime residential areas.

## Operating Hours Definition

Street lights operate from the end of civil dusk (beginning of nautical dusk) to the end of nautical dawn (beginning of civil dawn). This period is called "dusk-to-dawn" or approximately 4,100-4,165 hours annually (averaging 11.4 hours per night).

## Priority Hierarchy (Critical)

Photometrics AI **never averages or compromises** between competing priorities. Strict hierarchy—higher priorities are never degraded for lower ones:

1. **Dispatch** — CAD system integration (fire, crash codes) triggers 500ft illumination
2. **Demand Side Management** — Grid operator emergency triggers strategic dimming
3. **Transportation Safety** — Crosswalks, bike lanes, high-injury locations get +2 lux dusk-8PM
4. **Crime Prevention** — High drug/vehicle theft areas get increased lighting
5. **Special Events** — MLB games, Halloween (most dangerous night—treat local roads as crosswalks)
6. **Migratory Birds** — BirdCast integration dims low-speed/low-crime areas 2AM-sunrise on high-migration nights
7. **Default** — On at dusk, midnight dimming (sidewalks/yards to 0 lux), off at dawn

## Key Numbers

## National Energy Impact

Photometrics AI saves an average of 40% energy on the 60 million streetlights in the US, equivalent to 4,997 GWh annually or the energy consumption of approximately 466,000 homes.

**Calculation:**
- Annual consumption per streetlight: 50W × 11.4 hrs × 365.25 days = 208.19 kWh
- Total US consumption: 208.19 kWh × 60M = 12,491.4 GWh
- Savings at 40%: 12,491.4 × 0.40 = 4,996.56 GWh
- Equivalent homes: 4,996,560,000 kWh ÷ 10,715 kWh/household = 466,000 homes

## Current Traction
