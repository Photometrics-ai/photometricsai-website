# Go-to-Market Strategy

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary: Municipalities with NLC Investment

**Characteristics:**
- Already deployed networked lighting controls
- Frustrated by limited ROI from controls investment
- Facing pressure on energy costs, safety metrics, or sustainability goals
- Staff capacity to implement new software (or willing to use managed service)

**Pain Points:**
- "We bought these controls but just use them for on/off and fault detection"
- "Our dimming schedules are the same vendor presets everyone uses"
- "We can't prove we're meeting lighting standards"
- "We need to show progress on Vision Zero / climate action / grid resilience"

**Champions:** Public works directors, street lighting managers, sustainability officers, traffic safety engineers

### Secondary: Utilities (IOU/Municipal)

**Characteristics:**
- Own or manage street lighting assets
- Need demand-side flexibility resources
- Facing LV feeder constraints or evening peak challenges
- Decarbonization mandates

**Pain Points:**
- "Street lighting is a large, predictable load we can't optimize"
- "We need low-cost flexibility without customer disruption"
- "Our DSM programs don't include public lighting"
- "Data deluge from NLCs but no intelligence layer"

**Champions:** Distribution planning engineers, demand-side management program managers, innovation teams

### Tertiary: ESCOs and Lighting Management Companies

**Characteristics:**
- Manage street lighting for multiple municipalities
- Looking for differentiation beyond LED retrofits
- Recurring revenue models preferred
- Technical capacity to integrate new platforms

**Pain Points:**
- "LED retrofits are commoditized—everyone offers the same thing"
- "We need ongoing revenue, not just project fees"
- "Clients want proof of performance"

**Example:** ESCO managing Memphis suburbs (hundreds of thousands of lights in region)

## Pricing Model

### SaaS Subscription (Primary)

**$3-12 per light per year** based on:
- Deployment size (volume discounts)

- Feature set (basic optimization vs full dynamic scheduling)

**Includes:**
- Initial Target Lighting Layer creation
- Full system training for customer's luminaire types
- Unlimited optimization runs
- Unlimited schedule creation
- Standard NLC integrations

### One-Time Setup (Alternative)

For customers preferring CAPEX over OPEX:
- Upfront fee for initial optimization
- Optional annual maintenance/update fee
- Lower long-term cost but higher initial investment

### Managed Service (via Partners)

Certified partners provide:
- Ongoing TLL management and updates
- Priority/schedule configuration
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Premium pricing tier

### Outcome-Based (Negotiable)

For large deployments or risk-averse customers:
- Base fee plus performance bonus
- Tied to measured energy savings or peak reduction
- Aligns incentives with delivered value

## Utility Program Positioning

### Free Electrons Participation

Photometrics AI selected for Free Electrons utility innovation program—positions for direct engagement with global utility partners.

### Utility Pain Point Alignment

| Utility Need | Photometrics AI Solution |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Grid bottlenecks | Reduce LV feeder peak loading |
| Data deluge → intelligence | Convert NLC data to actionable parameters |
| Customer impact minimization | No field activity, no community disruption |
| Orchestration and visibility | Per-luminaire clarity and control |
| Low-cost flexibility | Software-only, existing infrastructure |
| Decarbonization | Reduce energy without new hardware |

### Value to Utilities

- $15.48/light/year in avoided costs (ACC-based: energy, capacity, GHG, T&D, losses)
- $2.39/light/year DSM program value (CBP + ELRP)
- $87M statewide annual grid value (California estimate)

---

## Market Size

### Streetlighting TAM

## Objection Handling

### "We already have controls"

"Controls give you the mechanism. We give you the intelligence about what to control. NLCs tell lights when to dim—we tell them how much, based on real photometric calculations."

### "How do we know it meets standards?"

"We calculate compliance against RP-8, CIE 115, or your local standard. Typical results: 91-97% of calculation points meet or exceed requirements. We can show you exactly where the 3-9% fall short."

### "What if it dims too much and someone complains?"

"Changes under 20% are imperceptible to the human eye, especially at night. We're optimizing within the range where people can't tell the difference—but energy bills can."

### "We don't have budget for new software"

"The value is $62/light/year. Our pricing is $3-12/light/year. ROI in under 12 months. For a 50,000-light city, that's $3.1M annual savings vs. maybe $300K cost."

### "Our utility owns the lights"

"Great—utilities are a primary target. They benefit from grid flexibility, demand response, and cost avoidance. We can approach them together or you can make the introduction."
