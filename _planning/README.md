# Photometrics AI: 3 Website Variants

Three distinct messaging approaches, each with its own design language.

| Variant | Directory | Lead With | Audience Mindset |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Financial** | `photometricsai-website` | ROI, numbers, proof | "Show me the math" |
| **Gap Selling** | `photometricsai-website-gap` | Cognitive dissonance | "I didn't know I had a problem" |
| **Values** | `photometricsai-website-values` | Mission, impact | "I want to work with people who care" |

## Key Insight

Each site needs a different **design**, not just different **copy**. The visual system, color palette, imagery, and emotional arc must match the sales approach.

## Folders

- `financial/` - Professional, data-forward, "safe bet"
- `gap/` - Tension and release, problem-agitation-solution
- `values/` - Mission-driven, warm, purpose-led

## Workflow

1. Refine plans in each folder
2. Get alignment on messaging and flow
3. Build each site
4. Test locally on different ports
5. Deploy for comparison
