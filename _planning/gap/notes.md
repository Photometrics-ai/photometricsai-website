# Gap Selling Site Notes

Refinements, feedback, and ideas.

---

## Current Issues

1. **Copy is done, design is not** - The words are right but the visual treatment doesn't create tension/release
2. **Same layout as financial site** - Needs its own visual identity
3. **No color shift** - Should get darker in problem sections, lighter in solution

---

## Design Changes Needed

- [ ] Hero: More breathing room, let words land
- [ ] Problem sections: Darker color treatment
- [ ] Solution sections: Brighter, relief evident
- [ ] Visual contrast between before/after states
- [ ] Consider split-screen or before/after imagery

## Questions

- How dark is too dark for the problem sections?
- Should we use actual imagery or keep it abstract?
- How dramatic should the color shift be?
