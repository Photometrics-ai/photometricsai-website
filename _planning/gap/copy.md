## Hero (THE GAP)

Your phone knows where you are.
Your thermostat learns your schedule.
Your car can drive itself.

**Your streetlights?** On at dusk. Off at dawn. Same brightness whether it's 2am on a Tuesday or 7pm on Halloween.

**Headline:** It's time for lighting that knows what day it is.

**CTA:** See what's possible

## What If (Scenarios)

### Halloween
Every crosswalk at full brightness while kids are out

### 2am Tuesday
Residential streets dimmed 40% - no one notices, grid breathes easier

### Emergency
Police dispatch triggers corridor lighting ahead of responders

### Migration Season
Lights dim automatically when BirdCast detects flocks overhead

### Demand Response
Utility calls for load shed, 50,000 lights respond in seconds

**Tagline:** This isn't science fiction. The software is ready. (Update when deployed)
