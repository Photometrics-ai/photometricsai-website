# Gap Selling Site Plan

**Directory:** `photometricsai-website-gap`
**Emotion:** Discomfort → Recognition → Relief
**Audience:** People who don't know they have a problem yet

## Design Philosophy

Create cognitive dissonance. The world is smart, your infrastructure is dumb. Make them feel the gap before offering the bridge. This is theatrical - tension, then resolution.

## Visual System

- **Color palette:** Dark/moody opening, brightens as solution appears
- **Typography:** More dramatic headlines, contrast between problem and solution
- **Imagery:** Contrast visuals - smart devices vs. static streetlights
- **Feel:** Before/after, night/day, old/new

## Page Flow

### 1. Hero (THE GAP)
- No logo prominence, no stats
- Just the uncomfortable truth:
  > Your phone knows where you are.
  > Your thermostat learns your schedule.
  > Your car can drive itself.
  > **Your streetlights?** On at dusk. Off at dawn.
- Visual: Split screen? Smart home vs. dumb street?
- CTA: "See what's possible" (scroll, not link away)
- **Design note:** This section should feel slightly uncomfortable

### 2. The Agitation (WHAT IF - Problem State)
- Stay in the discomfort briefly
- Show what's being missed:
  - Halloween: kids in dark crosswalks
  - 2am: full power for nobody
  - Emergency: no intelligent response
- Visual: Darker section, tension maintained
- **Design note:** Moodier colors, visual weight

### 3. The Turn (VISION - Solution State)
- Same scenarios, now solved
- Mood shifts - literally lighter colors
- "This isn't science fiction. It's running in Memphis."
- Visual: Relief, brightness, possibility
- **Design note:** Noticeable visual shift here - the "exhale"

### 4. Credibility (Quick)
- Minimal proof - just enough to trust
- Don't linger here, momentum matters

### 5. How It Works
- Simple, almost dismissive
- "No hardware. No retrofits. Just software."
- The ease is part of the relief

### 6. The Math (NOW they care)
- After emotional buy-in, show the numbers
- ROI feels like a bonus, not the pitch

### 7. CTA
- "Bring your streetlights into the 21st century"
- Forward-looking, not transactional

## Emotional Arc

```
Comfort → Dissonance → Agitation → Vision → Relief → Proof → Action
(smart world) (gap)    (pain)      (future) (solve) (trust) (convert)
```

## Current State

The gap site EXISTS but has the wrong design:
- Hero copy is right
- But no visual tension/release
- Same layout as financial site
- Needs darker opening that literally brightens
- Needs visual contrast between problem and solution states

## Required Changes

1. **Hero:** Reduce visual clutter, let the words breathe
2. **Color shift:** Dark → light as page progresses
3. **Problem section:** Add visual weight, moodier treatment
4. **Solution section:** Brighter, relief evident
5. **Pacing:** More whitespace, more dramatic reveals

## Notes

- The copy is done, the design is not
- This is a visual redesign, not a content rewrite
- Study PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution) landing pages for inspiration
