# Values Site Plan

**Directory:** `photometricsai-website-values`
**Emotion:** Shared purpose, doing right
**Audience:** Sustainability officers, community-focused city managers, mission-aligned buyers

## Design Philosophy

Mission-driven, human, warm. This speaks to people who see infrastructure as public stewardship. It says: "We're building something that matters. Join us."

## Visual System

- **Color palette:** Warmer tones, natural colors, less corporate blue
- **Typography:** Slightly softer, more approachable
- **Imagery:** Real photography - communities at night, wildlife, night skies, people
- **Feel:** Patagonia meets public infrastructure

## Page Flow

### 1. Hero (THE MISSION)
- Lead with purpose, not product
- Options:
  - "Light where it's needed. Dark where it's not."
  - "Better light. Safer streets. Darker skies."
  - "The right light. Nothing more."
- Visual: Beautiful night sky, well-lit crosswalk, bird in flight
- CTA: "Our Approach" / "Why We Built This"

### 2. The Stakes
- What's at risk without intelligent lighting:
  - Light pollution destroying ecosystems
  - Migratory birds dying (500M/year in US)
  - Energy waste in climate crisis
  - Communities underserved or overlit
- Visual: Impactful photography, not sad - urgent
- **Tone:** Not guilt, but awareness

### 3. The Belief
- What Photometrics AI stands for:
  - Right light, right place, right time
  - Safety and sustainability aren't tradeoffs
  - Public infrastructure should be intelligent
- Visual: Founder story, authenticity signals
- **Tone:** Conviction, not preaching

### 4. How It Works
- Framed as stewardship, not just efficiency
- "We optimize every fixture so nothing is wasted"
- Emphasize environmental features:
  - BirdCast integration
  - Dark sky compliance
  - Adaptive dimming

### 5. The Impact
- Qualitative + quantitative:
  - Energy saved = carbon reduced
  - Dimming during migration = birds protected
  - Standards compliance = safer streets
- Memphis as proof of impact, not just customer

### 6. Community / Partners
- Who else believes this
- Aligned organizations
- Standards bodies, environmental groups

### 7. CTA
- "Partner With Us" / "Join the Mission"
- Not transactional, relational

## Emotional Arc

```
Purpose → Stakes → Belief → Proof of Care → Impact → Invitation
(why)    (risk)   (values) (authenticity)  (results) (join us)
```

## Status

Does not exist yet. Build from scratch.

## Open Questions

- Which value to lead with?
  - Environmental (dark sky, birds, light pollution)
  - Community safety (crosswalks, crime reduction)
  - Public stewardship (taxpayer responsibility)
  - Climate/energy (carbon, grid efficiency)
- How much founder story to include?
- What imagery to source?

## Notes

- This is the most different from the other two
- Requires different photography approach
- May appeal to different buyer persona entirely
- Could be especially effective for sustainability-focused RFPs
