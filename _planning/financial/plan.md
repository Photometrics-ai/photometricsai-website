# Financial Site Plan

**Directory:** `photometricsai-website`
**Emotion:** Confidence, trust, "safe bet"
**Audience:** Procurement officers, CFOs, risk-averse decision makers

## Design Philosophy

Clean, corporate, data-forward. This is the site for people who need to justify the decision with numbers. It says: "We're professionals. Here's the math. This is a no-brainer."

## Visual System

- **Color palette:** Professional blues, white space, minimal accents
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif, emphasis on numerical data
- **Imagery:** Abstract/geometric, dashboards, charts - not emotional photography
- **Feel:** Bloomberg terminal meets modern SaaS

## Page Flow

### 1. Hero
- Lead: Bold number ($61/light/year or 35% savings)
- Subhead: What it is in one line
- CTA: "See the ROI" / "Calculate Your Savings"

### 2. Proof Bar
- 4 key stats in a row (deployment size, integrations, patents, compliance)
- Instant credibility, no scrolling required

### 3. The Value Breakdown
- Pie charts front and center
- Municipal vs Utility value split
- Detailed line items visible

### 4. How It Works
- Clean 4-5 step process
- Emphasize "no hardware, no risk"
- Technical but accessible

### 5. Case Study / Traction

### 6. ROI Calculator (Interactive)

## Emotional Arc

```
Credibility → Proof → Understanding → Calculation → Action
(trust)      (data)  (how)         (personalized) (convert)
```

## Status

This is the current production site. Needs refinement, not rebuild.

## Notes

- Current site already leans this direction
- Consider adding interactive ROI calculator
- Pie charts are good, keep them prominent
