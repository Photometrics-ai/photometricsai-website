## For Municipalities

**Asset Management Benefits ($30.44/light/year):**[^1]
- Extend luminaire life through optimized dimming
- Reduce maintenance truck rolls and costs
- 35% energy savings while maintaining lighting quality[^2]
- Better long-term budgeting and asset planning

**Quality of Life Benefits ($20.65/light/year):**[^3]
- Crime reduction through CPTED principles
- Traffic incident reduction (FHWA Proven Safety Countermeasure)[^4]
- Grid stability and demand response capability
- Support for Vision Zero and climate action goals

> "Photometrics AI delivers ~$61/streetlight/year in combined value. The cost to implement is far outweighed by the financial benefits."

## For Utilities

**Avoided Costs ($10.18/light/year):**[^5]
- Energy savings reduce wholesale procurement costs
- Generation capacity avoidance defers investment
- T&D capacity avoidance extends equipment life
- GHG compliance cost reduction

**Grid Operations Benefits:**
- Reduce evening and early-morning peak loading on LV feeders
- Controllable load with no customer disruption
- Surgical load shedding during emergencies prevents cascading outages
- Street lighting = 1-3% of total demand, higher share at night when active

**California Example:**
- 4.1M streetlights consuming 205 MW during peak[^6]
- 145 MW controllable demand reduction every summer evening
- Equivalent battery storage: ~$174M + years of permitting[^7]
- **Photometrics AI: <1% of cost, deploy in under 1 month**

> "Street lighting is one of the largest predictable evening loads on distribution networks that can be managed without customer impact, field activity, or infrastructure changes."

---

## For Communities

- **Safer streets** without construction disruption
- **Environmental protection** (BirdCast integration, reduced light pollution)
- **Support for nighttime economy** and vibrant neighborhoods
- **Equitable service** — data-driven, not politically influenced
- **Benefits within weeks**, not years

> "Implementation requires no disruption to daily life. Communities see benefits immediately without torn-up streets or lengthy project timelines."

## Scaling Examples

| City Size | Lights | Annual Value | Typical Annual Cost |
|-----------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Small suburb | 3,000 | $153K | $9-36K |
| Mid-size city | 10,000 | $511K | $30-120K |
| Large city | 50,000 | $2.55M | $150-600K |
| Major metro | 250,000 | $12.77M | $750K-3M |

## Additional Benefits (Hard to Quantify, Very Real)

### Strategic Funding Opportunities
- SS4A (Safe Streets For All)
- SMART grants
- DOE EECBG and GRIP programs
- DOJ Byrne JAG and COPS grants
- Data-driven evidence strengthens applications

### Liability Reduction
- Demonstrate purposeful, optimized lighting management
- Respond quickly to ROW changes (new crosswalks, bike lanes)
- Stronger legal position than "grouped standards" approach

### Policy Alignment
- Vision Zero
- Climate Action Plans
- DarkSky Recognized Codes
- Local outdoor lighting ordinances
