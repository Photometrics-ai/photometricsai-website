## Our Mission

Photometrics AI places light precisely where it's needed—at intersections, bike lanes, transit stops, and crosswalks—while minimizing overlighting and environmental impact. We believe cities shouldn't have to choose between safety, efficiency, and sustainability.

**Software-only. No hardware. No retrofits. No field activity.**

## Founder

### Ari Isaak, GISP

Ari Isaak is a nationally recognized pioneer in geospatial technologies and street lighting optimization, with over 25 years of experience leveraging GIS to improve public infrastructure.

Ari is currently building and commercializing Photometrics AI, which uses AI, mapping, and lighting controls to deliver the right light at the right place at the right time.

Previously, Ari founded and led Evari GIS Consulting, where he was instrumental in some of the nation's most complex street lighting projects, including in **Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, and Honolulu**.

He holds two patents related to dynamic lighting design using applied geography and photometry. An advocate for smarter, more adaptable infrastructure, Ari's work helps municipalities and utilities place light precisely where it's needed while minimizing overlighting and environmental impact.

His leadership in aligning technology with transportation safety, crime prevention, environmental protection, and energy resilience has positioned him at the forefront of modern lighting innovation.

## Why We Built This

Traditional street lighting design uses "typical layouts"—cookie-cutter approaches that apply the same fixtures and spacing across entire roadway types, ignoring the unique geometry of each location.

The result? Overlighting in some areas (wasted energy, light pollution) and underlighting in others (safety risks, standards violations).

**Photometrics AI is different.** We optimize every single luminaire based on its actual context—the slope of the road, the width of the intersection, the position of the mast arm, the beam spread of adjacent fixtures.

The technology to do this at scale only recently became possible through advances in GIS, machine learning, and networked lighting controls. We're the team that put it together.
