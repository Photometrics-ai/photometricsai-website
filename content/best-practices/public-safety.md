## The Folly of Easy Answers

The instinct is understandable: a neighborhood has a crime problem, so the city turns up the lights. More brightness, more safety. It feels right.

But crime is not a monolith. It is a collection of acts, each with its own choreography. Approximately **50% of crimes occur during daylight hours**. Only about **20% happen in public right-of-way spaces** - the overwhelming majority occur indoors, where streetlights provide no benefit at all.

And lighting affects different crimes differently. Auto theft may be deterred by bright illumination that increases the risk of detection. But some crimes actually **thrive in overly bright environments** where offenders can quickly assess valuables in parked vehicles. Other crimes require complete darkness to operate. Blanket brightness treats all of these the same way - and gets most of them wrong.

Research demonstrates that strategic lighting can reduce crime by up to 20%. But that word - *strategic* - is doing all the work. Effectiveness depends on precise placement and appropriate lighting characteristics for specific criminal behaviors. The question is never "how much light?" It's "what light, where, for what purpose?"

<h2 style="border-top: none; padding-top: 0;">Targeted Deterrence, Not Blanket Brightness</h2>

Photometrics AI enables law enforcement to deploy lighting strategies matched to actual crime patterns. The system identifies crime hotspots through integration with police data and applies appropriate lighting characteristics to make criminal activity uncomfortable and conspicuous.

This means different responses for different situations:

- **High-visibility areas** where the goal is to make potential offenders feel exposed
- **Elimination of dark pockets** that create hiding places adjacent to pedestrian routes
- **Reduced over-lighting** in areas where excessive brightness actually facilitates property crime

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles guide the system's approach - strategically shaping the lit environment so that potential offenders feel observed and legitimate users feel safe. Not more light everywhere. The right light in the right places.

<h2 style="border-top: none; padding-top: 0;">Emergency Response Integration</h2>

Beyond routine crime prevention, Photometrics AI transforms emergency response effectiveness through integration with **Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems** like Motorola PremierOne.

When emergency calls are dispatched, the system automatically illuminates the incident location and surrounding areas, providing arriving responders with optimal visibility **before they reach the scene**. This capability is particularly valuable for:

- **Nighttime medical emergencies** - paramedics can locate and assess patients faster
- **Structure fires** - firefighters gain visibility of the scene on approach
- **Traffic crashes** - illuminated scenes improve safety for responders and bystanders
- **Active incidents** - enhanced lighting supports tactical awareness and public safety

This is automatic. The dispatch system sends the alert, and the lights respond. No phone calls, no manual overrides, no delays.

<h2 style="border-top: none; padding-top: 0;">Dynamic Response</h2>

Public safety needs don't follow a fixed schedule. Photometrics AI enables dynamic responses beyond routine operations:

- **Special events or elevated threat periods** - enhanced lighting in specific areas
- **Following criminal incidents** - immediate area illumination for evidence preservation and witness safety
- **Seasonal patterns** - adjusted profiles based on known crime trends and community activity

Rather than simply increasing overall brightness everywhere, the system recognizes that effective public safety requires understanding *how* different situations respond to various lighting conditions. This targeted approach maximizes safety outcomes while avoiding unnecessary light pollution in areas where enhanced lighting provides no benefit.

Strategic lighting saves lives and prevents crime. The goal is to ensure light reaches where safety matters most, when it matters most.
