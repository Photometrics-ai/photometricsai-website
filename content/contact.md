## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need a certain NLC system?**
We're currently integrated with 2 major lighting control platforms. Contact us to confirm compatibility.

**What data do you need to get started?**
Asset inventory (locations, fixture types), IES photometric files, and API access to your NLC.

**What's the typical pilot size?**
Most pilots start with 2,000-5,000 lights to demonstrate value before scaling.

**Is there a hardware requirement?**
No. Photometrics AI is software-only. If you have networked lighting controls, you likely have everything you need.
